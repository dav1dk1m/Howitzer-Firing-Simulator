In 'Design Requirements' section, you need to specify 'Objectives, Functions and Constraints' each in a separate sub-section. You should consider at least four constraints overarching your design. Following is the list of some constraints (you can also come up your with your own constraints). 
#Design Requirements
## Objectives
Our objective is to create a projectile simulator to teach soldiers about kinematics and dynamics by simulating a howitzer shooting across a field. We will also create tests to ensure the simulator is accurate.
## Functions

## Constraints
1. Economic Factors 
    - Must create an easier and more cost efficent way to teach soliders before real life training
2. Regulatory Compliance (Security and Access)
3. Reliability
    - Must be 85% accurate
4. Sustainability and Environmental Factors
    - Must create an easier and more resource efficent way to teach soliders before real life training
5. Ethics
    - The simulator must teach the soliders so they can be prepared for real life training
6. Societal Impacts
