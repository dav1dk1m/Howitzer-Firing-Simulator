# Design Requirements

## Objectives
Our objective is to create a projectile simulator to teach soldiers about kinematics and dynamics by simulating a howitzer shooting across a field. We will also create tests  ensure the simulator is accurate.

## Constraints
1. Economic Factors 
    - Cost of development.
    - Cost of testing.
    - Cost of evaluation.
2. Reliability
    - Must be 99% accurate.
    - Must pass all tests.
3. Sustainability and Environmental Factors
    - Must create an easier and more resource efficent way to teach soldiers before real life training
4. Ethics
    - The simulator must teach the soldiers so they can be prepared for real life training
5. Regulatory Compliance (Security and Access)
    - Program can only be accessed by authorized members to avoid malicious intent.
    - Source code can only be accessed by developers who have sufficient authorization.
