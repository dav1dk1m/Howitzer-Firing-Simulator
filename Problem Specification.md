# Problem Specification

## Projectile Trajectory Simulation
The simulator should accurately simulate the trajectory of the projectile fired from the howitzer based on the given variables such as barrel pose, projectile mass, drag coefficient, initial speed, force applied, and gravity. It should take into account the effects of air resistance, gravity, and other relevant forces to calculate the projectile's trajectory.
