# Problem Specification

## Objective
Develop a Howitzer Firing Simulator to teach soldiers about the kinematics and dynamics involved in firing a howitzer projectile across an empty field.

## Simulator Variables
- Barrel pose (position and orientation): Control the position and orientation of the howitzer barrel.
- Initial speed: Set the initial velocity of the projectile.
- Force applied to the projectile: Control any external forces acting on the projectile.
Gravity: Account for the acceleration due to gravity.


## Rigid Body Kinematics and Dynamics:
The simulator should model the rigid body kinematics and dynamics of the projectile according to the following equations:

The inertial frame expresses the rigid body kinematics and dynamics of any object.

```math
洧녷(洧노) = 洧녺(洧노)


洧녴洧녺(洧노) = 洧녭(洧노) + 洧녭(洧노) + 洧녴洧녮 
```
- _m_ is the Mass of the projectile.
- _p_ is the position of the projectile
- _v_ is the linear velocity of the projectile
- _g_ is the acceleration due to gravity
- _f_  is the external force acting on the object
- f_d is the drag force acting on the projcet

In fluid dynamics, the drag force is, 

```math
f_d(t) = -0.5C洧랣Au(t)^2
```
- Drag coefficient (C): Determine the resistance to motion through the fluid.
- 洧랣 is the density of the fluid
- _A_ is the area of the projectile facing the fluid
- _u_ is the flow velocity relative to the projectile



## Project Schedule
