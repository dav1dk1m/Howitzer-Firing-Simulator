# Minimum Viable Product 2 (MVP 2)
## Description
MVP 2 is a critical step in our project. It is primarily concerned with capturing user input for two parameters: height and angle. By processing these inputs, the program can generate corresponding outputs that illustrate the position in a 2D plane, the total air time, and the maximum height attained.

This application aims to give the user a simplistic yet comprehensive understanding of how variations in height and angle can influence the trajectory of an object, represented in this context by its position, air time, and peak height.

## Features
1. User Input: The application accepts user inputs for 'height' and 'angle'. This allows users to understand how varying these parameters can impact the result.

2. 2D Position Representation: The application leverages user inputs to determine the object's position in a 2D plane, thereby visually illustrating its trajectory.

3. Air Time Calculation: The program also calculates the total air time of the object, offering insights into the duration for which the object stays airborne.

4. Maximum Height Determination: The software determines the maximum height attained by the object, helping users visualize the peak of the trajectory.

## User Guide
To provide user input, enter the initial height and launch angle when prompted by the application. Ensure that the height is input in meters (m) and the angle in degrees (Â°).

Post input, the application will calculate and display the object's trajectory in a 2D plane, its total air time, and the maximum height achieved.

## Testing
To ensure MVP 2 is robust and performs as expected, extensive testing has been carried out. You can review the tests and their results in the [MVP 2 Testing Document](https://gitlab.com/sseboys/ense375-project/-/blob/mvpTwo/TESTING.md).
