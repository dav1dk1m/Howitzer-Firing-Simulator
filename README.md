# Minimum Viable Product 2 (MVP 2)

## Description
MVP 2 is a significant advancement from the initial MVP, introducing more complex and detailed dynamics. It expands the range of input parameters to include the launch angle, rotation angle, mass, and velocity of the object. By manipulating these parameters, users can simulate more nuanced scenarios of projectile motion.

The outputs, as a consequence of this expansion, become more intricate. They depict the projectile's position in a 3D space, its range, maximum height, air time, and trajectory. MVP 2 thereby offers a comprehensive and detailed examination of projectile motion, enabling users to understand and visualize complex physical dynamics.

## Features
1. **Expanded User Input**: Users can input values for 'launch angle', 'rotation angle', 'mass', and 'velocity'. This provides a more immersive and dynamic experience as users can interact with a broader range of parameters.

2. **3D Position Representation**: The application processes these inputs to determine the object's position in a 3D space, enhancing the visual representation of the trajectory.

3. **Range Calculation**: This feature calculates the total horizontal distance covered by the object.

4. **Maximum Height and Air Time Computation**: The software computes the maximum height the object can reach and the total air time, which gives users a holistic view of the trajectory.

5. **Trajectory Display**: A detailed depiction of the object's trajectory is provided, giving users a comprehensive understanding of the object's motion.

## User Guide
1. Users are prompted to enter the initial launch angle, rotation angle, mass, and velocity of the object. It's essential to enter the angles in degrees (Â°), mass in kilograms (kg), and velocity in meters per second (m/s).

2. Upon input, the application will calculate and display the object's position in 3D space, range, maximum height, air time, and trajectory.

## Testing
To ensure that MVP 2 functions accurately and reliably, extensive testing has been carried out. You can review the tests and their results in the [MVP 2 Testing Document](https://gitlab.com/sseboys/ense375-project/-/blob/mvpTwo/TESTING.md).
