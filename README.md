## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Our software project's development will be divided into three Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stages. Each stage represents an increased level of functionality and user interaction.

### [MVP 1](https://gitlab.com/sseboys/ense375-project/-/tree/mvpOne)
---
The first stage will take user inputs for height and angle and produce outputs depicting the position in a 2D plane, air time, and maximum height. This provides the user with a basic understanding of how these variables influence the outcome.

### [MVP 2](https://gitlab.com/sseboys/ense375-project/-/tree/mvpTwo)
---
 The second stage will expand on this, accepting user inputs for launch angle, rotation angle, height, mass, and velocity. The outputs will be more detailed, including the position in a 3D space, range, maximum height, air time, and trajectory. 

### [MVP 3](https://gitlab.com/sseboys/ense375-project/-/tree/mvpThree)
___
 The final stage of development will build on MVP 2 by incorporating the effects of external forces. This creates the final product, where outputs are influenced by both user inputs and external environmental factors, providing the most detailed and accurate predictions.
