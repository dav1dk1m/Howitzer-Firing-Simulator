# Minimum Viable Product 1 (MVP 1)

## Description
MVP 1 is the cornerstone of our project, focusing on laying the groundwork for core mechanics. In this initial stage, the software accepts user inputs for height and angle. It then processes these parameters to calculate the corresponding position of the projectile in a 2D plane, the air time, and its maximum height.

This MVP aims to provide users with fundamental insights into the relationship between input variables and the outcomes of basic projectile motion. It serves as an educational and simulation tool, allowing users to manipulate initial conditions and understand their impact on the trajectory of a projectile.

## Features
1. **User Input**: The software allows users to input specific values for 'height' and 'angle'. By adjusting these variables, users can experiment with different scenarios and understand how these parameters influence the trajectory of the projectile.

2. **2D Position Representation**: The application processes user inputs to calculate the object's position in a 2D plane, offering a clear visual representation of the trajectory.

3. **Air Time Calculation**: The program computes the total time the object remains airborne, giving users an insight into the duration of the projectile's flight based on the input parameters.

4. **Maximum Height Determination**: The software calculates the maximum height that the object can reach during its flight, giving users a sense of the peak of the projectile's trajectory.

## User Guide
1. When prompted, enter the initial height and launch angle. Be sure to enter the height in meters (m) and the angle in degrees (Â°).

2. Once these inputs are provided, the application will calculate and display the object's position in a 2D plane, the total air time, and the maximum height achieved.

## Testing
We've conducted rigorous testing to ensure that MVP 1 operates as expected. You can review the details of these tests and their results in the [MVP 1 Testing Document](https://gitlab.com/sseboys/ense375-project/-/blob/mvpOne/TESTING.md).
