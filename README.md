# Minimum Viable Product 3 (MVP 3)

## Description
MVP 3 is the culmination of our efforts, representing the final stage of our project's development. Building upon the capabilities of MVP 2, this version introduces the effects of external forces into the simulation, adding an entirely new layer of complexity and realism.

With MVP 3, the outcomes of the simulation are determined by both user-defined inputs and the inclusion of external environmental factors. This results in a more comprehensive and intricate depiction of projectile motion, thereby providing the most detailed and accurate trajectory predictions. MVP 3 enhances the project's educational and exploratory value, accommodating real-world complexity within the simulation.

## Features
1. **Accounting for External Forces**: MVP 3 simulates the impact of external forces on the trajectory of the object. This feature increases the realism of the simulation, providing more accurate and comprehensive results.

2. **User-defined Inputs and Environmental Factors**: The simulation's outcomes are determined by a combination of user inputs and environmental conditions, giving users the opportunity to experiment within a more realistic context.

3. **Advanced Trajectory Predictions**: With the introduction of external forces, the software can provide more accurate trajectory predictions, reflecting the complexity of real-world conditions.

## User Guide
1. Enter user-defined inputs (e.g., launch angle, rotation angle, mass, velocity) and select the environmental conditions you wish to simulate (e.g., wind, gravity, air resistance).

2. The application will then compute and illustrate the object's trajectory, taking into account both the input parameters and the selected external forces.

## Testing
MVP 3 has undergone rigorous testing to ensure accurate and reliable performance. You can review our testing approach and results in the [MVP 3 Testing Document](https://gitlab.com/sseboys/ense375-project/-/blob/mvpThree/TESTING.md).
