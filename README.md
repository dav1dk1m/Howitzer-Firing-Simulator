### MVP
For this project, we will be progressing through three stages of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

**MVP 1**: In this stage, we will only have one variable that changes. All other factors will remain constant. 

**MVP 2**: The second stage expands to involve more variables and constants. Specifically, we will work with a few variables changing in the system while keeping several other factors constant. 

**MVP 3**: The third and final stage of our MVP is the most complex, involving all variables.
