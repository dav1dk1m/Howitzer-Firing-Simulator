### MVP
Our software project's development will be divided into three Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stages. Each stage represents an increased level of functionality and user interaction.

**[MVP 1](https://gitlab.com/sseboys/ense375-project/-/tree/mvpOne)**: In the initial stage, our software will obtain user inputs for height and  angle. This is the most basic interaction level, letting users input these two key parameters.

**[MVP 2](https://gitlab.com/sseboys/ense375-project/-/tree/mvpTwo)**: The second stage will extend the software's capabilities to also collect inputs for mass and area from users. This extends the depth of data collection and allows for more complex calculations.

**[MVP 3](https://gitlab.com/sseboys/ense375-project/-/tree/mvpThree)**: The final stage will be the most comprehensive. Here, the software will obtain user inputs for the density of the fluid and the drag coefficient. This will enable a thorough understanding of the environment and how it influences the outcomes.
